Simple Spellchecker
===================

> A simple spellchecker for Angular


Features
--------

**Simple Spellchecker** is a spellchecker module for Angular, that allows to check if a word is misspelled and to get spelling suggestions.

It comes with dictionaries for English, Spanish, French, German and Dutch, but you can easily add more languages by simply defining a text file with a list of valid words.


Usage
-----

In order to use the module, you must first install it using NPM.

    npm install ngx-spellchecker
    
or if you are using yarn
    
    yarn add ngx-spellchecker


1. Import SpellCheckerModule
```javascript
import { SpellCheckerModule } from 'ngx-spellchecker';

...

@NgModule({
   ...
   imports: [
     ...
     SpellCheckerModule,
    ...
   ],
   ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
2. Use it in your components / service

```javascript
import { SpellCheckerService } from 'ngx-spellchecker';

export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    fileURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobSamro/ngx-spellchecker/master/dict/normalized_en-US.dic"

    constructor(private spellCheckerService: SpellCheckerService, private httpClient: HttpClient) {

    }

    ngOnInit() {


    this.httpClient.get(this.fileURL, { responseType: 'text' }).subscribe((res: any) => {

      let dictionary = this.spellCheckerService.getDictionary(res)

      console.log(dictionary.spellCheck("test"))

    })

  }

}
```

Methods
-------

### Dictionary

The `Dictionary` class has six public methods: 

1. `getLength()`
2. `setWordlist()`
3. `spellCheck()`
4. `isMisspelled()`
5. `getSuggestions()`
6. `checkAndSuggest()`

#### getLength()

This method allows to get the quantity of words that the dictionary has.

Returns:
 * An integer with the number of words. 

#### setWordlist(wordlist)

This method allows to set the words of the dictionary.

Parameter:
 * `wordlist`: an array of strings.

### spellCheck(word)

This method allows to verify is a word is correctly written or not.

Parameter:
 * `word`: the word to verify.

Returns:
 * `true` if the word is in the dictionary, `false` if not. 

#### isMisspelled(word)

This method allows to verify is a word is misspelled or not.

Parameter:
 * `word`: the word to verify.

Returns:
 * `true` if the word is misspelled, `false` if not

#### getSuggestions(word [, limit] [, maxDistance])

This method allows to get spelling suggestions for a word.

Parameters:
 * `word`: the word used to generate the suggestions.
 * `limit`: the maximum number of suggestions to get (by default, 5).
 * `maxDistance`: the maximum _edit distance_ that a word can have from the `word` parameter, in order to being considered as a valid suggestion (by default, 2).

Returns:
 * An array of strings.

#### checkAndSuggest(word [, limit] [, maxDistance])

This method allows to verify if a word is misspelled and to get spelling suggestions.

Parameters:
 * `word`: the word to verify.
 * `limit`: the maximum number of suggestions to get (by default, 5).
 * `maxDistance`: the maximum _edit distance_ that a word can have from the `word` parameter, in order to being considered as a valid suggestion (by default, 2).

Returns:
 * An object with the fields `misspelled`, which contains a boolean, and `suggestions`, which contains an array of strings.

#### addRegex(regex)

This method adds a regular expression that will be used to verify if a word is valid even though is not in the dictionary.

This might be useful when avoiding marking special words as misspelled, such as numbers, emails, or URL addresses.

Parameters:
 * `regex`: a regular expression object.

#### clearRegex

This method removes all previous regular expressions added using the method `addRegex()`.

Add dictionaries
----------------

In order to use custom dictionaries, you must define a text file with a list of valid words, where each word is separated by a new line. 

### File's name

The file's extension must be `.dic`, and the name should (preferably) be composed by the language code and the region designator (e.g. `es-AR` if the language is Spanish and the region is Argentina).

Optionally you can also pack the file in a ZIP package, the module is going to be able to unzip it and read it as long as the `.zip` file has the same name has the `.dic` file (e.g. a file `es-AR.zip` that contains the file `es-AR.dic`). 

### File's encoding

The file must be encoded in UTF8 (without BOM), the words must be separated with a _Line Feed_ (i.e. `\n`) and not with a _Carriage Return_ plus a _Line Feed_ (i.e. `\r\n`), and the words must be sorted in ascending order.

The module can remove all unwanted characters and sort the words, if you either invoke the `normalize()` method or pack the file in a ZIP file (the module automatically calls the `normalize()` method after unzip it).
